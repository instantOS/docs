If you are coming from Windows or another desktop environment, you are likely
familiar with alt-tab menus. To use it, hold down alt and press tab multiple
times to toggle through a list of all open applications. Letting go of alt,
pressing enter or click on an entry will switch to the application. You can also
press tab just a single time and proceed to type in the application name.
There is also a more visual version available. It can be accessed using
++super+"^"++ (the caret key) or by right clicking on the status bar in the top right.
