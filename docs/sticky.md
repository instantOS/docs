# sticky windows

Sticky windows are visible no matter what tags are visible at any time.
All sticky windows have a green title bar.
They can be either floating or tiled.

To make a window sticky, focus it and press super + ctrl + s.
Pressing super + ctrl + s a second time unstickies it.

Some special windows behave in similar ways to sticky windows and are also
marked with a green title bar. Examples for this include overlays and
scratchpad windows.
