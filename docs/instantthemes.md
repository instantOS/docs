## Features

instantOS uses a program called instantTHEMES to theme the system. the goal of
instantTHEMES is to provide a simple way to create themes that look coherent
across the entire system. 

### Configure many parts of the OS

A theme can declaratively theme the following system components
- Mouse Cursor
- GTK
- Icon theme
- Fonts
- QT

### Extensible

instantTHEMES integrates with imosid which allows to include theming
configuration for arbitrary programs, all without messing with user
configuration

### Simple workflow

Themes are special packages that can be shared easily and installed with a
single command. They include everything instantTHEMES needs to install and
apply all parts %% of the theme. 

## Apply/switch themes
