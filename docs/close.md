## Closing windows

Closing applications can be done in several ways. ++super+q++ and ++alt+f4++
both work. There also is a close button on the left side of the blue window
title.  A window can be directly closed from the window bar by middle clicking
on its name. When a window is floating it can additionally be closed by middle
clicking while hovering outside the green border.

## Locking windows

Right clicking on the close button will lock the window. This will prevent the
window from getting closed until it is unlocked again. Overlays will by
default be locked but can be unlocked just like any other window.
