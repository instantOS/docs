# Window drawing

The window drawing feature works similar to plan9's rio window manager.  To use
it, press ++super+shift+d++ or click on the far right of the blue window title
indicator.  
Your cursor will change to a cross-hair.  
You can now drag out a rectangle and letting go of the left mouse button makes
the current window take that size.  
You can also draw on different monitors.  
Clicking on a different window while in drawing mode will move the current
window on top of it and copy its dimensions.
