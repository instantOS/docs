# Scratchpad

The scratchpad is like a tag that sits on top of all your other tags at all times
Its visibility can be toggled on and off using the shortcut ++super+s++
To move a window to the scratchpad you can use ++super+shift+s++, moving it out
of the scratchpad is done by moving the window to a regular tag.
Its functionality in general works a lot like the Steam overlay, if you're familiar
with that you'll feel right at home.

All windows on the scratchpad are floating and will overlay over anything
that's not on the scratchpad including fullscreen windows.
