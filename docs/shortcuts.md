instantOS can be controlled using the mouse or the keyboard.
If you are a more advanced user, you can likely skip this part of the documentation.

All keybindings follow a simple convention: Hold down a set of special keys,
also called modifiers, and then press a normal key to do an action. Most
keybindings make use of the super key. On most keyboards it will have a Windows
logo on it, on a Mac it is the command key.  When noting a keyboard shortcut,
the modifiers are listed first, followed by the action key. For example:
++super+a++ refers to holding down the ++super++ key and tapping the ++a++ key.
++super+shift+space++ refers to holding down both the ++super++ and ++shift++
key (the order doesn't matter) and tapping the ++space++ bar. You can perform
multiple actions by keeping the modifier keys held down and pressing a sequence
of action keys.
