# Vim hotkeys

Some keybindings in instantOS make use of the vim movement keys.
They are taken from the text editor vim and are also used in lots of other
applications.
They work like this:

```txt
        Up
         ^
         |
         k
 left<--h l-->right
         j
         |
         V
         Down
```

They might look strange at first but the reasoning behind them is that they are
on the home row and easier to access than the arrow keys when typing.
Lots of Linux users are already familiar with them and using existing muscle
memory is always good. It also leaves the arrow keys to be used for other functionality.
