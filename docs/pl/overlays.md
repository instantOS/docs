Overlays work similar to drop-down terminals like Guake, but are integrated
into the WM and work with any application. To create an overlay, press 
++super+ctrl+w++ or drag a window to the top right corner. You can now toggle the
overlay on or off by pressing ++super+w++ or hovering over the corner.

The overlay is locked by default which means it can't be closed by accident
until it is unlocked. Right clicking on it in the title bar resets its
dimensions. Right click dragging on it in the title bar lets you change the
size. Positional or horizontal changes will not be permanent until the overlay
is unlocked by right clicking on the close button.

Declaring a new overlay will replace the old one. The old overlay will return
to being a normal window.

Alternative way to create an overlay: ++super+"Click"++ on the layout indicator.
