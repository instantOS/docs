# Updating instantOS

To update instantOS, open a terminal and run ```yay```.  It will prompt
you for your root password and to confirm installing the updates.  This
tool will update all programs from the official repositories and the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org)

Just like with any other Linux distro, you can continue using your
computer while installing updates.  Updates to some instantOS components
will however require a restart to become visible.

## instantupdate

instantos comes with its own update tool that ensures the system keeps working
by also applying workarounds and changes to the OS configuration. If you are an
experienced user and regularly modify the OS yourself you might want to keep
things more predictable and stay with only pacman updates.
