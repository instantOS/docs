# Updating instantOS

To update instantOS, open a terminal and run ```yay```.  It will prompt you for
your root password and to confirm installing the updates.  This tool will
update all programs from the official repositories and the
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org)

Just like with any other Linux distro, you can continue using your computer
while installing updates.  Updates to some instantOS components will however
require a restart to become visible.
