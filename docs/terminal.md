# Terminal

## Opening a terminal

A terminal can be opened up by pressing Return on an empty tag or super +
Return at any time. You can also use the mouse by middle clicking on the
status bar in the top right. The Super + Space application launcher can also
launch any application in a terminal. Press shift + left/right arrow key while
using the launcher to switch ti terminal mode.

## Copy paste

To highlight text, hold down the shift key and drag out the selection using
your mouse. You can then press Ctrl + Shift + C to copy the selected text and
Ctrl + Shift + V to paste it.

## tmux

By default, all terminals open in a tmux session.  This allows for features
like tabs, split windows and detaching from the session.  Tmux is very well
documented so this manual won't go into detail about it.

## Configuration

The terminal emulator in use is Luke Smith's st build that you can find
[here](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st) Some keybindings have been changed
but otherwise it is unaltered.  Colors can be changed from Xresources, but
please read [this](https://instantos.io/youtube/customize) before doing any
theming.
