# Terminal

## Opening a terminal

A terminal can be opened up with ++return++ on an empty tag or ++super+return++
at any time. You can also use the mouse by middle clicking on the status bar in
the top right. The ++super+space++ application launcher can also launch any
application in a terminal. Press ++shift+"left/right"++ arrow key while using the
launcher to switch ti terminal mode.

## Copy paste

To highlight text, hold down the shift key and drag out the selection using
your mouse. You can then press ++ctrl+shift+c++ to copy the selected text and
++ctrl+shift+v++ to paste it.

## tmux

By default, all terminals open in a tmux session. This allows for features
like tabs, split windows and detaching from the session. Tmux is very well
documented so this manual won't go into detail about it.

## Configuration

The terminal emulator in use is
[st-instantos](https://github.com/instantOS/st-instantos/) which a build of the
suckless terminal. It is nothing special and deliberately kept barebones
because most of the things you could add into a terminal emulator can be done
much better and reliable using tmux.
