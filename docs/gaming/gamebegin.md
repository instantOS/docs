# Getting started with gaming on Linux and gaming on instantOS

This article is meant to get you started with gaming on Linux as a new user.
There are four main ways to play games on Linux

1. Using the official repositories. There are some games that are completely
free and open source. These are available in the default repositories (aka App
store). But because most games are commercial products, this leaves you with a
very small library of titles that are often just tech demos for game engines
that have not aged well...
2. Steam native: Steam is a digital games store that has excellent support for
Linux. It has hundreds of thousands of high quality games, many of which run
on Linux.
3. Steam Play: Linux has the ability to run windows games using a tool called
proton. It is developed by valve and is itself a fork of wine. Many of the
features of proton have also been integrated into wine. The steam client has a
feature called steam play that allows downloading windows games from steam and
playing them using proton. By default, steam play is only enabled for titles
that are guaranteed to work, but you can enable it for all games in the
settings. Many games are only unofficially supported but run just fine using
proton. Protondb is a website that lists games and how well they run using
proton.
4. Lutris: Lutris is a game launcher with a corresponding website which
contains thousands of community made installers. It allows playing native
games, can be used as a launcher for steam games and games running in an
emulator and most interestingly, comes with its own wine versions.
